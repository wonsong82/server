copy with permissions intact:
rsync -avzh /var/lib/mysql /path/to/new/place

back up (in case something goes wrong):
mv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/_mysql

create a new empty directory in place of old:
mkdir /var/lib/mysql

bind mount the new location to the old:
mount -B /path/to/new/place /var/lib/mysql
